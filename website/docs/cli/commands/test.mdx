# Command: test

The `terraform test` command reads in Terraform testing files and executes the tests detailed within.

The `test` command, and the test file syntax, are targeted at module authors wishing to validate and test their shared modules. Despite this, it is also possible to use the `test` command to validate root modules.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform test [options]`

This command searches the current directory and the specified testing directory (`tests`, by default) for any Terraform testing files, and executes the tests as specified. Test files and their syntax are discussed in detail within the [Tests](/terraform/language/tests) language page.

Terraform will then execute a series of Terraform plan or apply commands, according to the specifications within the test files, and validate the relevant plan and state files, again, according to the specifications within the test files.

> **Warning:** The Terraform test command can create real infrastructure than can cost you money. Read the [Terraform Test Cleanup](#terraform-test-cleanup) section for best practices on ensuring created infrastructure is destroyed.

## General Options

The following options apply to the Terraform `test` command:

* `-json` Displays machine-readable JSON output for the testing results.

* `-test-directory=<relative directory>` Override the directory that Terraform will look into for testing files. Note, Terraform always loads testing files within the main configuration directory. The default testing directory is `tests`.

## State Management

Each Terraform test file will maintain the Terraform state within memory as it executes, starting empty. This state is entirely separate from any state that exists for the configuration under test, so you can safely execute Terraform test commands without affecting any live infrastructure.

### Terraform Test Cleanup

The Terraform `test` command creates real infrastructure. Once each test file has fully executed, Terraform will attempt to destroy any remaining infrastructure. If it cannot do this, Terraform will report a list of resources that were created and not removed.

You should monitor the output of the test command closely to ensure any created infrastructure has been successfully removed and perform manual cleanup if not. Where possible, dedicated testing accounts should be created within the target providers that can be routinely and safely purged to ensure accidental costly resources aren't left behind.

Terraform will also provide diagnostics explaining why the cleanup could not be completed automatically. You should resolve these diagnostics to ensure future clean up operations are successful.
