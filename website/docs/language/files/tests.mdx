# Test Files

Some commands, such as `test`, `init`, and `validate`, will also load Terraform test files for your configuration.

These files contain specifications for Terraform test executions. For more information about the Terraform `test` command read [Command: `test`](/terraform/cli/commands/test). For more information about the syntax and Terraform test file language read [Tests - Configuration Language](/terraform/language/tests).

## File Extension

Terraform test files are discovered based on the file extensions `.tftest` and `.tftest.json`.

## Test File Locations

Terraform will load all test files within your root configuration directory.

Terraform will also load all test files within the testing directory. The testing directory can be overridden with the `-tests-directory` flag on all commands that load the configuration. The default testing directory is `tests` relative to your configuration directory.
